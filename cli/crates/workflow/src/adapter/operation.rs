//! Closed source- and target-adapter operation enums.
//!
//! [`SourceOperation`] (`extract | survey`) and [`TargetOperation`]
//! (`shape | build | merge`) are the typed `briefs.keys()` carried by
//! the axis-specific manifest structs in `core.rs`. Living together in
//! this module keeps the source/target operation pair symmetric.
//!
//! Wire format is kebab-case on both sides (`extract | survey` /
//! `shape | build | merge`) — the [`Serialize`] / [`Deserialize`]
//! derives, the [`strum::Display`] impl, and the [`strum::EnumString`]
//! impl all share the same `kebab-case` rule, so the YAML manifest
//! key, the slice outcome `phase` field, and any
//! `parse::<TargetOperation>()` call all agree on a single wire
//! spelling.
